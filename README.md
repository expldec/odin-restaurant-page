# odin-restaurant-page
This is my take on [The Odin Project's Restaurant Page assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page).

This exercise makes use of plain Webpack and ES6 modules.
The objective is to create a barebones restaurant homepage that's completely rendered in Javascript via DOM Manipulation.
